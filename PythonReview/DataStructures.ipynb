    "### For Loop\n",
    "A `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range). It executes a block of code repeatedly for each item in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### While Loop\n",
    "A `while` loop continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It is often used when the number of iterations is unknown beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Break Statement\n",
    "The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely. When encountered, it immediately stops the loop and transfers control to the next statement outside the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested Loops\n",
    "Nested loops are loops within loops. The inner loop completes all its iterations for each iteration of the outer loop."

    "A `try` statement is used to wrap a block of code that might raise an exception. If an exception occurs within the `try` block, the program will look for a matching `except` block to handle the exception, rather than crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Except Statement\n",
    "The `except` statement is used to catch and handle exceptions that occur in the `try` block. You can specify the type of exception you want to catch or use a generic `except` to catch all exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finally Statement\n",
    "The `finally` statement is used to define a block of code that will run no matter what happens in the `try` and `except` blocks. It is often used for cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing resources, that must occur whether an exception is raised or not."
